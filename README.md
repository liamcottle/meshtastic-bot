# Meshtastic Bot

A very basic bot that connects to a Meshtastic device over Bluetooth and replies to direct messages.

## Commands

`ping`: replies with `pong`

## How to use?

> NOTE: You will need to edit the bluetooth device name in `index.js` to match the device you want to run the bot from.

```
npm install
node index.js
```

## TODO

- Support serial connections for nodes connected directly to machine running the bot code.
